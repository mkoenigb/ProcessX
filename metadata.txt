description=This Plug-In adds a new processing provider to QGIS. It contains a great variety of different processing algorithms.
version=1.7
author=Mario Koenigbauer
email=mkoenigb@gmx.de

about=This Plug-In provides a collection of various processing algorithms for QGIS. For example "Split Lines at Nearest Points by Condition", "Join Attributes by Nearest with Condition", "Create Nested Grid", "Nearest Points To Path", "Conditional Intersection", "Remove Self-Overlapping Portions", "Translate Duplicate Features to Columns", "Count Nearest Features by Category", etc. See Changelog or Readme for a complete list and more details.

changelog=
    v1.7
    Added algorithms:
    - Extend Lines To Nearest Points By Condition
    Improvements:
    - Moved all conditional-inputs to advanced parameters tab
    - Added handover for feedback and context to other processing tools to all processx-processing tools
    - Added handover for feedback to build of spatial index to all processx-processing tools
    - Added ZM-values support to "Nearest Points To Path" (please take a look at Readme for information about 3D measure)
    - Added ZM-values support to "Interpolate Datetime along Line" (please take a look at Readme for information about 3D measure)
    - Reworked "Create Perpendicular Lines From Nearest Points", added ZM support and fixed QgsWkbType (due to a change in QGIS v3.30)
    v1.6
    Added algorithms:
    - Densify Lines With Nearest Points By Condition
    - Split Lines At Nearest Points By Condition
    Improvements:
    - fixed 5th parameter of Nearest Points to Path to QgsWkbType (due to a change in QGIS v3.30)
    v1.5
    Added algorithms:
    - Translate Duplicate Features to Columns
    - Count Nearest Features by Category
    - Remove Self-Overlapping Portions by Condition
    - Conditional Difference
    - Create Perpendicular Lines from Nearest Points by Condition
    Improvements:
    - Removed unused operator import from CountFeaturesInFeaturesByCategory
    - Removed unused spatial index from RandomlyRedistributeFeaturesInsidePolygon
    - Improved performance of many algorithms by moving expression_context.appendScopes(QgsExpressionContextUtils.globalProjectLayerScopes()) outside of the loops
    v1.4
    Added algorithms:
    - Create Polygon from Extent
    - Randomly Redistribute Features inside Polygon
    - Count Features in Features by Category
    Improvements:
    - Fixed geometric predicate "equals" in CountFeaturesInFeaturesWithCondition
    v1.3
    Added algorithms:
    - Count Nearest Features by Condition
    - Interpolate DateTime Along Line
    Improvements:
    - Added some missing feedback.isCanceled() listeners
    v1.2
    Added algorithms:
    - Snap Vertices to nearest Points by Condition
    - Nearest Points to Path
    Improvements:
    - Fixed not working FeatureSource-Inputs (replaced with VectorLayer-Input for those algorithms which do not support it and fixed it for those which are able to use this feature)
    v1.1.2
    Improvements:
    - Completely reworked Create Nested Grid algorithm (fixed bugs, added new features: choose x and y factor for subgrids yourself, choose which grid lies on top)
    v1.1.1 
    Improvements:
    - Fixed progress indicator for Create Nested Grid algorithm
    v1.1 
    Added algorithms:
    - Create Nested Grid
    - Count Points in Polygons with Condition
    Improvements:
    - Added second condition to conditional algorithms, allowing e.g. BETWEEN operations
    - Added order by clause to some algorithms
    - Improved efficiency of some algorithms
    - Removed NOT operator from conditional algorithms as it cannot be used for comparisions; Use IS NOT instead
    - Some minor and general improvements
    v1.0 Initial Release. 
    Added algorithms: 
    - OpenTripPlanner Routes
    - OpenTripPlanner Traveltime
    - Conditional Intersection
    - Count Features in Features with Condition
    - Join attributes by nearest with Condition
    - Select possible duplicate features by similarity
    - Create Timepolygons with Pointcount
    - New Layer from GeoJSON String
