# ProcessX
Repository for QGIS ProcessX Plug-In

This Plug-In adds a new processing provider to QGIS. It contains a variety of processing algorithms.

Please report bugs or issues you encounter with these algorithms on https://github.com/mkoenigb/processx/issues/

The algorithms are:

### Vector - Conditional
- (New in v1.0) **Join Attributes By Nearest With Condition**: Joins the attributes of the x nearest features if an expression condition returns true.
- (New in v1.0) **Count Features In Features With Condition**: Counts features in another layers features (can be lines and polygons as well as points and different geometric predicates like intersects, within, disjoint, equals...) if an expression condition returns true.
- (New in v1.0) **Select Duplicates By Similarity**: Selects possible duplicates in a layer by distance and attribute like exact attribute match, soundex, hamming distance, levenshtein distance or longest common substring.
- (New in v1.0) **Conditional Intersection**: Creates an intersection geometry between the features of two layers only if an expression condition returns true. This algorithm can also be used as polygon-self-intersection.
- (New in v1.1) **Count Points in Polygons With Condition**: Counts points in polygons (intersects or within) if an expression condition returns true (This algorithm is a lot faster than "Count Features In Features With Condition" when counting 2D-Single-Points in Polygons).
- (New in v1.2) **Snap Vertices to nearest Points by Condition**: Snaps the vertices of a given layer (singleline, multiline, polygon or point) to the nearest point of a given point layer by optional attribute and distance conditions.
- (New in v1.3) **Count Nearest Features by Condition**: Counts the number of nearby features by a given maximum distance and optional attribute condition(s). You can also set whether a feature should be counted only once, if so, it will only be counted to the nearest feature.
- (New in v1.4) **Count Features in Features by Category**: Counts features in features (both can be Points, Lines or Polygons of any type) per a given category, evaluated either via an expression or a field.
- (New in v1.5) **Count Nearest Features by Category**: Counts nearest features per a given category, evaluated either via an expression or a field.
- (New in v1.5) **Remove Self-Overlapping Portions by Condition**: Removes self overlapping portions within a layer by an optional attribute condition. You can choose the iteration order and which feature should keep overlapping parts.
- (New in v1.5) **Conditional Difference**: Builds a difference between two or more features of different or the same layer if an optional attribute condition is met. This algorithm is based on *Remove Self-Overlapping Portions by Condition* and enhances its possibilities.
- (New in v1.6) **Densify Lines With Nearest Points By Condition**: This algorithm inserts new vertices to given lines based on the nearest points of a given point layer. You can either modify the lines path or leave it unchanged and only densified.
- (New in v1.6) **Split Lines At Nearest Points By Condition**: This algorithm splits lines at the nearest points by using an optional attribute condition. You can either modify the lines path and split the lines at the nearest points themselves or preserve the line paths and split the lines at interpolated points, nearest to the nearest points.
- (New in v1.7) **Extend Lines To Nearest Points By Condition**: Extends lines and/or line parts to nearest points by using an optional attribute condition. The initial line path is not modified.

### Vector - Creation
- (New in v1.0) **Create Timepolygons With Pointcount**: Creates x duplicates of given polygons in a given timerange with from- and to-timestamp and the pointcount falling inbetween this timerange and geometry.
- (New in v1.0) **Geometry Layer From Geojson String Field**: Creates a duplicated layer of the input with modified geometry, taken from a field with a valid GeoJSON-String.
- (New in v1.1) **Create Nested Grid**: Creates a parent grid and x child grids. You can choose how many childcells a parent shall have in x and y direction.
- (New in v1.2) **Nearest Points to Path**: Connects points to paths based on their distance.
- (New in v1.4) **Create Polygon From Extent**: Takes an extent as input and an optional CRS and creates a new polygon layer from it with some basic attributes.
- (New in v1.4) **Randomly Redistribute Features Inside Polygon**: Takes a point, line or polygon layer as input and redistributes its features randomly, by using translate and rotate, inside a polygon the feature is within.
- (New in v1.5) **Translate Duplicate Features to Columns**: Translates features (rows) to columns by an duplicate-identifier, which can be an expression, geometry or a field.
- (New in v1.5) **Create Perpendicular Lines from Nearest Points by Condition**: Creates perpendicular lines on a line layer based on nearest points by an optional attribute condition.

### Vector - Interpolation
- (New in v1.3) **Interpolate DateTime Along Line**: Segmentizes a line by a given distance and interpolates Start- and End-DateTime for these segments. This algorithm is designed for animating lines with Temporal Controller.

### OpenTripPlanner
- (New in v1.0) **OTP Routes**: Requests routes from an OpenTripPlanner instance and creates a linelayer from the returned geometry and attributes.
- (New in v1.0) **OTP Traveltime**: Adds some attributes to a given layer based on OpenTripPlanner routing results.
